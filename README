A plugin for jQuery javascript library

DESCRIPTION

MagicGradient applies a vertical gradient to the text of an element.  
It does this by cloning the element's content N times,and applying 
the CSS clip property and a color (from an Array) to each clone.

Each clone is a direct child of the target element, and has the CSS 
class 'magicGradient' in order to allow further scripting access.

The number of clones equals the number of indices in the gradient 
(see below).

MagicGradient is made obsolete by the more robust and flexible CSS3
gradient capabilities.

ARGUMENTS

MagicGradient accepts a single javascript object as an argument.  
Available properties:

* gradient: Array of color expressions (required)

Other properties may be supported in the future.

USAGE

// chrome effect
var clr = new Array('#2989CC', 
                    '#2989CC', 
                    '#4499D5', 
                    '#6DB2E5', 
                    '#9BCDF5', 
                    '#C8E7FF', 
                    '#ECF9FF', 
                    '#FFFFFF', 
                    '#AE7700', 
                    '#DDA50C', 
                    '#E8BC43', 
                    '#F2D68B', 
                    '#FAEED0', 
                    '#FAEED0');

$('h1').magicGradient({'gradient': clr});
 
// two-tone effect
$('a').magicGradient({'gradient': new Array('#bf2034', '#e3c390')});

LIMITATIONS

MagicGradient is a text effect; applying it to elements which have 
block-level descendants will likely cause undesired results.  It will 
happily preserve inline descendants (including links).

MagicGradient does not apply to any child element's text-decoration.

MagicGradient does not refresh "automagically" when a reflow event 
occurs.

Notes:
A smoother transition of colors will always look better.  However, 
fewer colors equals more speed.

When applying to inline elements, it may be necessary to duplicate 
the first and last colors in the array in order to display the full 
range of colors.  This is because line-height is usually greater than 
the height of the text.

Due to how MagicGradient works, it can affect accessibility.  Text 
selections can also behave strangely.

Of course, IE6 doesn't always play nice.

TODO:
Put the original content in a container for hiding.  It can show 
through as a ghost edge when anti-aliased, or when rounding errors 
inside the browser result in imperfect alignment.

Add a function to remove the gradient.

Feedback is welcome.
